# AI-Powered Document Summarizer & Q&A

## Overview
This project is an **AI-Powered Document Summarizer & Q&A App** built using **React**, **CopilotKit**, and **Node.js**. It allows users to upload PDF files, extract their content, and ask questions about the uploaded document in a conversational interface. The app provides an interactive and user-friendly way to interact with large documents without reading them manually.

---

## Key Features
1. **PDF Upload and Parsing**: Upload a PDF file to extract its textual content using the backend.
2. **Question & Answer Interface**: Ask natural-language questions about the uploaded document, and get relevant answers.
3. **CopilotKit Integration**: Seamlessly integrates CopilotKit to manage AI queries and streamline user interactions.
4. **Local Hosting**: Run the project entirely on your local machine.
5. **Dynamic Chat Interface**: Query the document interactively and view responses dynamically.

---

## How CopilotKit Has Helped
- **Simplified AI Interactions**: CopilotKit enabled easy integration of an AI-powered Q&A system for document queries.
- **Tooling Support**: The library provided tools for creating a conversational AI agent that handles user queries efficiently.
- **Ease of Development**: With CopilotKit, we could focus on building a smooth user experience rather than handling complex AI infrastructure.

   - Run `npm install` in the backend directory.

2. **Frontend Not Starting**:
   - Ensure React and `react-scripts` are installed.
   - Clear `node_modules` and reinstall:
     ```bash
     rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
     npm install
     ```

3. **PDF Parsing Issues**:
   - Ensure the uploaded file is a valid PDF.
   - Check the backend logs for errors.
